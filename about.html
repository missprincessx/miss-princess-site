    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I’m someone who values good conversation, warmth, and making people feel at ease.
  My approach is relaxed and personal — nothing stiff or formal(unless requested), just genuine interaction.
</p>
<p>
  Every experience I offer is tailored with care. I like to take the time to understand
  what feels comfortable and enjoyable for you, so you always feel welcome and respected.
</p>
<p>
  This space is all about creating a friendly, inviting environment where you can feel
  comfortable exploring what I offer. Whether you’re here to chat, unwind, or
  simply connect, I’m here to make sure you have a positive experience.

  <h2>✨ Outfit Requests ✨</h2>
  <p>
    I love keeping things fresh and creative — if you’d like to request a special look for our time together
    you’re welcome to make an <strong>Outfit Request</strong>. This helps tailor each experience to your personal aesthetic or theme.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that if a specific outfit, colour theme, or accessory isn’t already part of my/our wardrobe,
    <strong>the cost of the outfit will need to be covered in advance</strong>.
    This ensures I can find something that matches your request perfectly.
  </p>

  <p>
    🛍️ <strong>Special Outfit Request Fee:</strong> £30 (base styling fee)  
    💕 <strong>Plus outfit cost:</strong> variable (typically £20–£80 depending on brand or delivery time)
  </p>

  <p>
    Outfit requests are confirmed only after the fee is received and the item has been purchased.
    You’ll receive a quick confirmation once everything is arranged.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make an outfit request,please get in touch via the Contact Page and include your idea/request!
